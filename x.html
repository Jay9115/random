            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Online students often struggle with fragmented platforms for studying, communication, and collaboration,
                leading to inefficiencies and reduced engagement. Without an integrated system, accessing and sharing
                study-related materials becomes challenging, often resulting in mismatched resources that do not cater
                to individual learning needs. <strong>Fusionall</strong> addresses this by offering a unified web
                platform that integrates chat, file sharing, a blog module, and study groups. This streamlined solution
                enhances collaboration and engagement, making online learning more effective and interactive.</p>

            <h2>Project Objectives and Scope</h2>
            <h3>Objectives:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a working web application.</li>
                <li>Enable interactions within a collaborative environment.</li>
                <li>Implement messaging, document sharing, and group suggestions.</li>
                <li>Integrate a blog module for knowledge sharing.</li>
                <li>Facilitate study groups for sharing essential study materials and information.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Scope:</h3>
            <p>The scope of the Fusionall project is to deliver a comprehensive web-based platform designed to enhance
                collaborative learning among students. The end goal is to create a unified solution that allows students
                to engage in real-time communication via chat, share files, use a blog module for sharing knowledge and
                resources, and access a group where admins can share study-related materials. This platform will
                streamline various aspects of online education into a single, cohesive system.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Background Study of Existing System</h2>
            <p>Current platforms like Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, and GeeksforGeeks each offer unique
                strengths such as user-friendly interfaces, robust collaboration tools, and seamless integration with
                other services. However, they also have significant weaknesses, including feature overload and the need
                for multiple platforms to fulfill different needs. Key gaps identified are the lack of integration
                across functionalities and the absence of a unified experience for students. Fusionall aims to bridge
                these gaps by combining chat, file sharing, group suggestions, a blog module, and a group with
                admin-only access for sharing study-related materials into a single, cohesive platform, enhancing the
                online educational experience.</p>

            <h2>Methodology and Approach</h2>
            <p>The methodology for developing Fusionall follows a structured and iterative process. We begin by
                analyzing requirements and designing a user-friendly interface with a scalable system. For development,
                we use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React.js for the frontend, while Node.js with MongoDB powers the
                backend. The platform will be continuously monitored, and improvements will be made based on user
                feedback to effectively meet educational needs.</p>
